            <h1>Enabling Firebug</h1>
            
            <p class="bigPara">Firebug tries to stay out of your way until <a href="#YouNeedIt">you need it</a>; 
            it goes away if <a href="#YouSuspendIt">you suspend it</a>.
            Firebug can be optimized for <a href="#HTML_CSS_Authors">HTML authors, CSS designers</a>, 
            <a href="#JavascriptDevs">Javascript developers</a>, and <a href="#SiteEngineers">Site Engineers</a>.  
             You can <a href="#BySite">focus on a site</a> or <a href="#ByPanel">work across sites</a> using a specific Firebug feature.</p>

            <div class="section" id="YouNeedId">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen" src="GreyFirebugIconClosed.gif" />
                <h3>One Click to Start Firebug</h3>
                <p>After you install Firebug you will see a gray 'Firebug' in the Firefox status bar (along the bottom of the window).
                Click on the Bug to start. Firebug will open in the bottom of your web page.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen odd" src="InstantHTML_CSS_DOM.gif"/>
                <h3>Instant HTML, CSS, and DOM Views</h3>
                <p>  As soon as you open Firebug you can examine the Web page markup, styling, and object model. 
                Three tabs -- <a href="../../html.html">HTML</a>, <a href="../../css.html">CSS</a>, and <a href="../../dom.html">DOM</a> -- activate as soon as you open Firebug.
                If you are a HTML author or CSS designer, this may be all of the Firebug you need. 
                As long as you don't enable other panels, the overhead caused by using the Firebug should be small:
                by default Firebug keeps all the expensive features off.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="BySite">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen" src="DisabledFirebugPage.gif" />
                <h3>Digging Deeper into a Web site</h3>
                <p>To work on Javascript code or to study the network action on a site, you need to enable one or more Firebug panels.
                If you select the Console, Script, or Net panels, you will see a control for enabling 
                one or more of these panels for the site you are viewing. Select the panels you need, then push the big 
                button to enable them. (<b>Firebug will reload the page</b> These panels use active listeners and Firebug needs to 
                reload the page to fill the panels with data).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section"  id="YouSuspendIt">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen odd" src="SuspendFirebug.gif">
                <h3>Coming up for Air (or email...)</h3>
                <p>Once you have enabled one of the active-listener panels, Firebug will cause some overhead on every page. 
                The Firebug team is working to reduce this overhead, 
                but for now Firebug has a quick way to <b>suspend</b> the listeners.
                Look back at Firefox's status bar: you will see that the Firebug icon is now orange, meaning 'on'.
                To suspend the active panels, right click on the Firebug icon
                and select <i>Suspend Firebug</i>; to resume select <i>Resume Firebug</i> or simply open Firebug again.                
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="ByPanel">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen" src="ConsoleEnableAlways.gif">
                <h3>Firebug For Every Site</h3>
                <p>Once you are fully addicted to Firebug you can take the next step on enablement: enable panels for all sites.</p>
                <p>On the Console tab you will find a mini-menu. If you select <b id="EnableAlways">Enabled</b>, then the Console panel
                will be enabled for all sites you visit, unless you explicitly disable the Console for that site.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="DisableSite">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen odd" src="DisableSite.gif">
                <h3>Firebug for Almost Every Site</h3>
                <p>When you have Console, Script or Net panel enabled for every site, you might like disable Firebug for a few sites.
                (This is similar to Firebug 1.0, which was enabled by default but allowed sites to be disabled).</p>
                <p>From the panel tab's mini-menu, select <b>Disable for ...</b>. The panel will revert to the disabled state.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section" id="WhyEnabled">
                <img class="smallScreen cheapScreen" src="WhyEnabled.gif">
                <h3 >Why is Firebug Still On???</h3>
                <p>Whenever the Firebug status bar icon is orange (not gray), Firebug has one or more active listeners.
                If you get confused about why Firebug is still on, hover over the icon. Firebug may be activated by a tab
                you currently do not have on top.</p>

                <h3>Working with Site Permissions</h3>
                <p>To tweek the enable/disable settings for any panel across all sites, select <b>Sites...</b> from the mini-menu.</p>
            </div>

                <h3 >Firebug For HTML Authors and CSS Designers</h3>
                <p>If your primary work in Firebug is with HTML or CSS, leave all the active-listener panels <b>Disabled</b>.
                Firebug will have minimal overhead when you are not using it. You probably want enable the Console to look for errors.
                Enable one site at a time or enable the Console (only) for all sites, then selectively disable it for 
                sites like your email</p>

                <h3>Firebug for Javascript Developers</h3>
                <p>For Javascript you'll want the Console and Script panels enabled. You may was well run with these panels fully enabled, 
                then suspend Firebug when you want to read e-mail or other wise goof off. Just remember to set the panels for the goof-off 
                sites to <b>Disabled for...</b> so suspend stays suspended.</p>

                <p>If your primary job is monitoring load times and looking out for 404s, activate the Net panel and perhaps the Console.
