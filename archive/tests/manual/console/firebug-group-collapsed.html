Expected initial console output:

<pre>
Not in a group
[-] Default Group: 1
 |  Inside default group
 |_ This is initially visible in the console
[+] New Group method: 2
After groups
</pre>

After clicking on the [+] of "New Group method", expected result:

<pre>
Not in a group
[-] Default Group: 1
 |  Inside default group
 |_ This is initially visible in the console
[-] New Group method: 2
 |  This is still added to the group, but is not visible initially
 |_ To view these messages, one would have to expand the group
After groups
</pre>
