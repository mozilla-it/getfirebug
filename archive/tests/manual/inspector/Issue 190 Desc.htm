    <h1>Issue 190</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a input type text, set it to disabled</li>
        <li>Try to inspect it with firebug</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    Disabled elements raise no mouseover event (in fact they raise no events at all) so the inspector cannot inspect them. The current workaround is to overlay disabled elements with proxy elements.
