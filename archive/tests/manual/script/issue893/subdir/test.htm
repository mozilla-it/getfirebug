<title>Test Case Firebug Issue 893 doubled Script listing if loaded by relative URL</title>
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="../js/test.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<input type="button" onclick="show();" value="CLICKME IF YOU WANT"/>
<p>
List shows up each relative included file *twice*. Only the resolved
pathname is "breakpointable". The relative ones aren't.
</p>
<p>
The list of files on the Script panel should include two files, test.js and test.htm.
The file names should not include dots or double dots.
