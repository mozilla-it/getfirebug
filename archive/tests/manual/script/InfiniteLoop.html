Thanks tito, but I need to know what version of firebug, Firefox->Tools->Addons->Firebug

I'm going to mark this as 1.05 meaning I'll eventually mark it WONTFIX unless I hear
that its Firebug 1.1.

Please report FF3 crashes to Mozilla bugzilla, see
http://groups.google.com/group/firebug/web/faq-about-firebug

I see this on FF3 with FB 1.2.

Looks like it's https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=303821
