Issue 496: 	 Stepping through code doesn't accurately reflect code execution



Add a comment and make changes below 	Reported by stephanieliese, Yesterday (25 hours ago)

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set a breakpoint at line 7 ( x = 10 )
2. Step into each line of code
3. When it gets to line 18, it should not appear to execute line 19 because
the condition returns false
4. Firebug goes to the alert(y) on line 19 as if the condition returned
true but this statement will never be executed by the browser
5. Firebug then skips down to line 24 which doesn't make any sense

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected output would have been to skip line 19 and then bypass the rest of
the if statement down to line 26


What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
1.0, Windows Vista
