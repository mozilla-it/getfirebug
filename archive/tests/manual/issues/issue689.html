        <script type="application/javascript;version=1.7">

var x = "A value";
function f() {
  let x = "A different value";
  let xx = "No problem here";
  let put_breakpoint_here;

        <h1>Firebug Issue 689 Firebug doesn't display values of let variables when globals w/ same name are present</h1>
        <pre>
        What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open script below in Firefox
2. Set breakpoint at indicated spot
3. Watch value of x
3. Run/load
4. Value of x = "A value", not "Another value"

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
* At that point, "x" should refer to the "x" in scope, but it doesn't
* It might be nice if there were a simple way to see both variables, but
seeing the one in scope is much more important
