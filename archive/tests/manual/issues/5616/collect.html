<h3>ProTools</h3>
<p>ProTools is the top of the line DAW. there is all sorts of sound studio hardware that works with it, such as hard diskrecording, mixers, FX units, and other stuff.</p>
<p>Sonar comes with a very easy touse use UI and has an entry-level $99 package for home users - however,this package is only for Windows and works best on 64-bit and has a minimum processor type requirement.</p>
<p>popular windows/mac DAW, can probably edit a number of file formats including MIDI and probably MP3.</p>

<h3>Audacity</h3>
<p>this is a low-end open-source multi-track editor for waveform autio only. it can do wav and ogg and a native aup I think, but NO MIDI. plugins for mp3 are available, however that format's plugins are not legal in many countries due to license requirements.</p>

<h3>Jack Server</h3>
<p>Jack Server is primarily made for linux - this is why the plyugins you see out there only come in source code form, and you need a unix-style compile environment to compile it.  it has a growing set of instruments, including the famous Fender electric pieno I think it is (never found out what it was called).</p>
<p>there are mixers,vu meters, and other things you can use.  SOME pugins are available for windows.  but VERY FEW.</p>

//it is recommended that:
//- a chunk of content which covers multiple id's should be enclosed in nested div tags with single id attributes or similar element to div. only 1 id per element or browser will break.
//- this script should be placed in the body at the end of the html document.
//- suggested you use a div tag with your content in p and h1-6 tags.
//- having id's in the content might mess up the browser. try  a unit test on multiple browserds, it might work -but it may not. so be sure.  
//  the question is whether using .innerHTML duplicates those id's and thus makes that id unusable/invalid.
//- surround your search keywords with <a href="javascript:collect('keyword-with-dashes','regular keyword');">regular keyword</a>
