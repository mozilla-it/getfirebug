What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create an HTML web page with head/body sections.
2. In the head section include a J/S file but make sure the attributes of
the script element appear on multiple lines.  E.g make this element span 3
lines.
3. Add some content to the body including a script element that defines
some J/S functions.
4.  Place a breakpoint in the J/S code and you'll see that in order to this
the breakpoint on the line you want, you actually have to set the
breakpoint two lines below (using the example above) because the FireBug
parser thinks the input spans only one line.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected result is that FireBug detects multiple lines for one element
in the head element and accounts for this.  FireBug appears to treat
multiple lines for the contents of an element in the head element as one
and thus the debugger is off by the number of extra lines beyond 1.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
1.05, Kubuntu Feisty.
