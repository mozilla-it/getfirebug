Oh, in this example, I think the break is at something like 70,003 and Fb says line
4469. The numbers I used above were from my own code, not this test case.

The test case was created via this php file (you can change the line endings):

<?php
header("Content-type: text/javascript; charset=utf-8");

for ($i=0;$i<70000;$i++){
    echo "// comment \r\n";
}
?>

function test(){
    asdf.adsf = 7
}

test();
