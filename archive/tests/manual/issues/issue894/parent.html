    <h1>Issue 894: 	 Script not shown when breakpoint hits an opener function </h1>
    <pre>
    Reported by frsantos, Jun 30, 2008

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open "parent.html" and set a breakpoint inside "callback" function
2. Click the "click me" button
3. When in breakpoint try to step (F10 or F11)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The pointer should go through all lines of function "callback" with
"parent.html" code shown. Instead, although variables and stack are OK, the
"child.html" code is shown, and there is no clue about which is the current
executed line.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Firebug 1.2.0b4, Firefox 3.0. Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; es-ES;
rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061015 Firefox/3.0

Please provide any additional information below.
It apparently works as intended with local files ("file:///...") but fails
when accessed through a web server ("http://localhost/...")


    </pre>
        <input type="button" onClick="init()" value="click me" >
        <div>Number of callbacks: <span id="result"></span></div>
    </body>
</html>
