<title>Issue 1328: Script tag does not always reflect the actual content</title>
<script>
function addScript(mode) {
var head = document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],
script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "data:application/javascript,alert('firebug')";
head.appendChild(script);
}

This report is based on issue 241

1. Download the attached files into the same folder
2. Open the html file and firebug on the HTML panel, expand the HEAD section
3. Click the button and notice the new script tag appear along with an alert
4. Click the [+] button next to the new script tag and look at the content,
it should say: alert("you have not changed me");
5. Right click the newly created script node and click "Delete Element".
6. Open issue-241.js in a text editor and change the alert text to "you
have changed me", save/overwrite the file.
7. Click the button again, the new alert text should show.
9. Perform step 4

Expected result:
The edited script is shown

Actual result:
The script text still says alert("you have not changed me");

This issue seems to only appear when loading the testcase from a local
file:/// uri, it did not happen to me when running it through a http
server. This seems to be related to issue 520.

Tested using firebug 1.4.0a10 on firefox 3.0.5
