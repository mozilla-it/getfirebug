What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a web page that reads:

&lang;html>&lang;body>&lang;script type="application/javascript;version=1.7">
var foo = function() { console.trace(); };
var bar = function() { foo(); };
bar();
&lang;/script>&lang;/body>&lang;/html>

2. load the page and check console.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected output: stack trace showing foo() and bar(), with file, line, and
links
Instead I see: "Firebug failed to get stack trace with any frames" in red


What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

Firebug 1.2b3, Firefox 3 rc 3, Win Server 2003 SP 2


Please provide any additional information below.

Worked fine in FB 1.05 on Fx 2.0.0.14.

Comment 1 by your.sheepy, Today (17 hours ago)

Firebug 1.1.0b11 on FB ends up in "console is not defined" error, with functional
error stack trace.
