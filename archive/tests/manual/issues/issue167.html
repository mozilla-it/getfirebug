<title>firebug 167</title>
<style type="text/css">body { font-size: 6px; {</style>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>

<pre>
I was not able to reproduce this the way he described but did discover something
possibly related.

STEP 1:
Open the attached file.

STEP 2:
Inspect the style of the text. (It says font-size: 6px;)

STEP 3:
Open the Firefox preference pane (Tools > Options... on windows). Go to the tab
"Content" and click "Advanced" in the "Fonts & Colors" section.

STEP 4:
Set the minimum font size to 12 and OK your way out of the settings windows.

STEP 5:
Refresh the page and reperform STEP 2.

Expected result:
The font-size of the text reflects the actual size of the text (12px).

What happens:
It shows the author style which is not what Firefox is using.

This might be a bug in Firefox. The computed style also doesn't show the real font-size
