		<div> Issue 1127:  	 console fails to load into reload iframe (Frame > Reload Frame)</div>
		<iframe src="iframe.html" width="400" height="400" frameborder=1></iframe>
		<pre>
1. load this page in firefox
2. firebug console says: "my iframe log statement"
3. right click in iframe, choose This Frame > Reload Frame
4. firebug console only has the first one, statement not logged again until you refresh the parent frame 
(index.html)

zipped example attached. has been a bug since development for FF3 started. very frustrating in large 
applications. thanks...
