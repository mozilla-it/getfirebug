    <p><pre><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Using attached test case, load test.html.
2. Set breakpoints at lines 3 & 6 in test.js.
3. Reload page in order to hit breakpoints.

<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Both breakpoints should be hit.  But only the line 3 breakpoint causes the
debugger to break.  The breakpoint (line 6) that should get hit when
running in the IFRAME does not break.
I tested with Venkman, and both breakpoints were hit, as expected.

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
FF 3rc2, Firebug 1.2.0b3, Mac OS X 10.5.3
