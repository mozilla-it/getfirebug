<body>
<pre>Here's a test case.  I have found that this problem doesn't happen with simple vars,
but rather with properties of an object.

Also, there's another issue with editing of string properties.  Each time you edit
and hit enter, it adds another layer of quotes wrapping the string. 

When the breakpoint is hit, expand bar, doubleclick x - it changes to a string
'false'.  Doubleclick again and hit enter - it adds another set of quotes to the
property.

The quoting issue can also be seen by editing z, a property that started as a string.

</pre>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
foo = function() {
    var bar = {x:true, y:1, z:'123'};
debugger;
    bar.y++;
    if (typeof bar.x == 'string') {
        alert('x is string');
    }
};

window.onload = function() {
    foo();
}

</script>
