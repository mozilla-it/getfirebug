     Issue 1882:    same url - console reports errors to different tab

Created a new profile.
Open the attached file(or any page that will produce for example a js
error).Re-open it in different tabs.
After reloading you will see that the error is only reported to one's tab
console panel.
It should appear in the tab in which the page is reloaded.
In order to understand it clearer,after each reload, press the clear button
of the console,so you will be able the next time you reload,to see in which
tab's console it was reported(the js error).
