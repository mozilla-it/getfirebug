What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Goto Console
2. run:  var foo = function(){}; foo.prototype.foo = 'bar';
3. Goto DOM view, find 'foo', expand it, looks at its prototype



What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected output: "Object foo=bar" or something saying "foo=bar"
Instead I see: "undefined"



What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

Firebug 1.2.0b3
Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Windows Server 2003 SP 2



Please provide any additional information below.

In older versions the base object 'foo' will also be displayed in red
indicating its prototype is populated instead of green like functions with
empty prototype, which is also very helpful.

Not certain whether this is intentional or not, but the inability to check
prototype in DOM view certainly makes me very frustrated, so much that it
is forcing me to downgrade, despite worse performance, since my recent
project have lots of prototypes that is not feasible to check one by one
from console.
