From http://getfirebug.com/commandline.html
       By default, command line expressions are relative to the top-level
window of the page. cd() allows you to use the window of a frame in the
page instead.

I believe the behavior when a function is called from the console is to
first check if it is a firebug api command, if not then it checks the top
level. 

cd is supposed to alter this by having it check the desired frame instead
of top, in 1.2.03b this is not working.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the attached example.htm  
2. In the firebug console, type 'test()'
3. Expected output is an alert reading 'This is test Top.', which succeeds.
4. In the firebug console, type 'cd(a)'
5. In the firebug console, type 'test()'

This time the expected output should be 'This is test A.', instead the
output reads 'This is test Top.'

You can get the desired output by typing 'a.test()', but cd should change
the scope so that functions are looked for in the frame named 'a' if they
aren't found in the console api.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
      1.2.03b, Windows XP
