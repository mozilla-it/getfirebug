Issue 979: Firebug adds a hidden breakpoint when adding a breakpoint in a dynamically created function

     Reported by splintor, Today (4 hours ago)

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the attached test.htm file
2. Press F12 to show Firebug
3. Switch to Script tab and enable it if it is disabled
4. Add a breakpoint in line 10 (console.log("in inner");)
5. Click the “test” button in the page

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Firebug debugger should break at line 10. Instead, it first breaks on line
9, and when pressing F8 to continue, it breaks again in line 10.
Removing the breakpoint (either by clicking the line number or from the
breakpoints tab) removes the hidden breakpoint from line 9, but now there
is one on line 10, so if you now click on the "test" button, the debugger
breaks at line 10, although there seems to be no breakpoint in the page.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
FF3.0.1, FB1.2.0b6 on Windows XP
