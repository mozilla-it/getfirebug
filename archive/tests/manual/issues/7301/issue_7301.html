	<script type="text/javascript" src="issue_7301.js"></script>

<body>
<button onclick="funcTest()">Click me!</button>
<pre>
1) Open Firebug on the attached test case file issue_7301.html
2) Enable Script panel and select issue_7301.js
3) Set a breakpoint at line 4 and line 5
4) Edit issue_7301.js adding a line break inside the "funcTest" function
function funcTest()
{
//line break
	var message = 1234567890;
	console.log(message);
}
5) Now line 4 is non-executable line.
6) Close tab issue_7301.html
7) Open issue_7301.html again and select issue_7301.js
8) Now only a breakpoint at line 5
9) remove breakpoint
10) Click on "Click me!"


What is the expected result? 
  Debugger should not stop

What do you see instead?  
	The debugger is halted at line 5 

I think it's the same problem as described in comment 22 by Farshid
