      <li>Load this page.</li>
      <li>Observe that console reports that "init" is written from
      line 34 of this file.  <br/>
      <b>Issue a:</b> Line 34 is not in the script section.</li>
      <li>Observe that console reports that "external" is written from
      line 34 of this file.<br/>
      <b>Issue b:</b> It should report the file name as "external.js",
      and it should report that the line number is 2.</li>
