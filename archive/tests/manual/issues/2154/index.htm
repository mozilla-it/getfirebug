<h1>No console object in workers - test case</h1>

<p>See also <a href="script.js">main script source</a> and <a href="worker.js">worker source</a>.</p>

<p>A worker starts on window.onload, adding 1 to a variable <code>i = 1</code> in a loop until i is 5000. When i is a multiple of 100, the worker posts a message to the main script, which adds the current value of i to the list below. When i is a multiple of 500, the worker (in addition) tries to call <code>console.log()</code>, but fails miserably. A <code>try... catch...</code> block notices this, and posts a failure message, which is also added to the list below.</p>

<p>Output from Worker:</p>
