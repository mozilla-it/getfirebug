What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. open the testcase
2. when firebug breaks, do not dismiss the bubble.
3. Click on functions in the stack breadcrumbs bar (not sure how you call
this) to see the different functions in the call stack.

Several similar bubbles appear at different points in the code, sometimes
at the same position as the existing ones. All then have to be dismissed
manually.

- I don't expect a bubble to appear when I click on the function that
called the erroneous one.
- I don't expect such a bubble to have a "OK" button, I would expect it to
disappear as soon as I click on anything in the Firebug window, including
the bubble itself. I would also expect to be able to bring back the bubble
by clicking the stop point icon, which should be different than the
standard green triangle
- I don't expect an error bubble to be blue... Red or orange, maybe?

Which version of Firebug? 1.5xa21
Which version of Firefox? 3.5.2
On what operating system? WinXP
