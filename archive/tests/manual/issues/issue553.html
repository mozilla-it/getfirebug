Ok, maybe a little description for this testcase.

1. Open the file
2. Go to the console tab and make sure the Show CSS Errors option is enabled
3. Reload and notice that a style declaration is dropped.

The original submitter expects the dropped !important; to show next to the preceding
declaration. The dropping of a declaration is only visible if an optional checkbox is
checked in the console, so it is easy to overlook.

This is probably an enhancement, not a defect.
