I expect to see 'Test' in the firebug console, but instead i see 'console
is not defined'

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
SVN 1142 (1.3 branch) works just fine, but SVN 1143 (1.3 Branch) has this bug.

This is using Firefox nightly 3.1b2pre (20081009) on OS X 10.5.5
