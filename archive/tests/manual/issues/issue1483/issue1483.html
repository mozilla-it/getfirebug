<h1>Issue 1483: Scripts fail to load when page reloaded during paused execution</h1>
		<pre>
		5). Set a break point on a line in index.js.  I set my break point to the
console.log line.

6). Reload the page, this should trigger the break point.

7). Immediately reload the page again while the script execution is paused
on the break point.  (i.e. don't do anything after the break point is
triggered but reload the page.)

8). Notice that...

  A). The break point did not trigger again.

  B). The console did not output "init" (if using the example code).

  C). If you go into the script tab and select the index.js script to view,
the contents of index.js will be blank (if connectd via http:) plain text
(if connected via file:)
