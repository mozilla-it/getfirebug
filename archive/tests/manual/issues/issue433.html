What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the attached HTML file and enable Firebug.
2. Move the mouse over the green div and then onto the red.  This should
open the debugger inside of a mouseout event handler.
3. Add a watch for e.relatedTarget and relatedTarget.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Firebug should report e.relatedTarget as referencing the outer div, but it
is reported as being null.  On the previous line executed, relatedTarget
was set equal to e.relatedTarget, and the watch for this variable displays
the proper reference.  Obviously, the reported value for e.relatedTarget is
incorrect.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
I tried this on the current Firebug release (1.1.0b10) and also downloaded
and installed the latest trunk (1.1.0b11).  I have Firefox 2.0.0.11 and
Vista Business.  I also verified this on another machine with XP Pro.

<div id="outerdiv" style="position: absolute; width: 500px; height: 500px; background-color: red; left: 0; right: 0;">
    <div id="innerdiv" style="position: absolute; width: 300px; height: 300px; background-color: green; left: 100px; top: 100px;"></div>
</div>
